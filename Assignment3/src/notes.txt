We compiled and ran on the command line ... the file redirects
on the right were not commented out in our scripts. So you can see where
the associated files came from.

# Making sure Paint compiles
javac -nowarn ca/utoronto/utm/paint/Paint.java                          #2>$OUTPUTDIR/javac.errors
# After this, we ran a tool that extracts the class definitions.
# You can find them in the .definition files in your repo.

# Testing Saving (1.1)

# Testing the parser (1.2)

To see the extent of changes to your files you can do something
like the following on Unix/Linux. Have not had a chance to check this yet.

git diff COMMIT_ID_2 COMMIT_ID_2  # for the changes
git diff COMMIT_ID_2 COMMIT_ID_2 | grep -e '^+' | wc # should be at most 10
git diff COMMIT_ID_2 COMMIT_ID_2 | grep -e '^-' | wc # should be at most 10

One last thing. In case someone is trying to game the resubmit. The 
files must be relatively nicely indented and not too long. No removing
a line and replacing it with a very very long line.
