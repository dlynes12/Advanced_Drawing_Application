# User Stories/Bugs (add as appropriate), modify at each Sprint Planning Meeting
# If a USER STORY is large, break it into smaller user stories.

TYPE     : USER STORY 3.1
NAME     : Save Feature
OWNER    :
PRIORITY : 1
ESTIMATE :
AS A     : user
I WANT   : a user interface that allows me to specify where to save the
Paint, then saves all Paint commands to a file.
SO THAT  :
IMPL DTL : Implementation details for the save feature:

This amounts to saving the command list to a file according
to the Paint Save File Format.
Do this using what you have learned in class about FileIO.
You can find the format of the save file in the
Assignment3 project under Assignment3/paintSaveFileFormat.txt.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
TYPE     : USER STORY 3.2
NAME     : Load a Saved File
OWNER    :
PRIORITY : 2
ESTIMATE :
AS A     : user
I WANT   : the ability to open previously saved Paint programs. A file dialog
should appear, allowing me to choose the file to load. If the file is not in
the correct format, provide an appropriate error message.
SO THAT  :
IMPL DTL : Implementation details for the load feature:

Read a file in Paint Save File Format, being careful to parse
each line using an appropriate regular expression/expressions. 
You can find the format of the save file in the
Assignment3 project under Assignment3/paintSaveFileFormat.txt.

The result of the execution of the load method should modify
the given PaintModel. Some ShapeCommands will require careful parsing. 
For example, you will have to walk
through a squiggle to properly parse it using Patterns and groups.

I WANT   :
DEPENDSON: USER STORY 3.1
IMPL DTL : 

Now that USER STORY 3.1 is in place...

Code to save may not be simple. To simplify it, add the Visitor
Design pattern to the Model, then move all code relating to saving
the model to an appropriate Visitor.
