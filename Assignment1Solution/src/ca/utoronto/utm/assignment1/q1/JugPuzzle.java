/**
 * A Jug Puzzle consists of three Jugs (numbered 0,1 and 2) with capacities 8,5
 * and 3 respectively. Initially, jug 0 is full, the other two are empty. The
 * player of the game spills liquid between the jugs (move) until both jugs 0
 * and 1 contain 4 units of liquid each. When a player makes a move, one Jug spills into
 * another. The JugPuzzle knows how many moves have taken place since the start
 * of the game. A spill ends as soon as one jug is empty or one jug is filled.
